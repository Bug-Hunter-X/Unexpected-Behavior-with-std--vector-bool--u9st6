std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that often leads to unexpected behavior due to its non-standard implementation.  It doesn't store booleans as individual bits; instead, it uses a bitset internally. This can cause performance issues and problems with standard vector operations.  For example, accessing elements may be slower than with a `std::vector<char>` and using iterators may be less efficient.
